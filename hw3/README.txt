Hello! as of Tue Feb 14 18:40:07 UTC 2017 the run button, and the EZ runner do not function like I would like it to, but if you have the patience to run make and ./a.out from a terminal below it should run as needed. 

Currently it pulls words from the two strings in main.cpp (end, start) change them if you'd like, but for the most part it works just alright with "slow" and "fast". You should notice that my tree has repeats (the same word multiple times) I haven't fixed this yet but it works for now. 

Thanks, 
Jeremiah
